# OpenGOAL Jak2 HD Texture Pack

Fairly straight forward, I upscaled all the textures using ESRGAN (defaulted to 4x) and this is the result. Somethings did need to be removed, specifically the animated textures, as these break when upscaled at the moment, but as far as I can tell, it's unnoticable during gameplay. There are a FEW odd artifacts here and there, but only if you're really looking for them.

# How to install

Just download it from releases, and load it into OpenGOAL's launcher, and enable it. Couldn't be simpler, and changes should only occur if A. I find something better B. I can add the animated textures down the line or C. the texture layout changes entirely. Other than that, enjoy!

# Warnings

This will likely be heavy on your computer during initial install, my system hangs when initially compiling it, but runs smooth as butter once it's done. Expect your computer to choke a little when adding in all the textures.
